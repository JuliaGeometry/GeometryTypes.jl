A `Simplex` is a generalization of an N-dimensional tetrahedra and can be thought
of as a minimal convex set containing the specified points.

* A 0-simplex is a point.
* A 1-simplex is a line segment.
* A 2-simplex is a triangle.
* A 3-simplex is a tetrahedron.

Note that this datatype is offset by one compared to the traditional
mathematical terminology. So a one-simplex is represented as `Simplex{2,T}`.
This is for a simpler implementation.

It applies to infinite dimensions. The structure of this type is designed
to allow embedding in higher-order spaces by parameterizing on `T`.

A Face is typically used when constructing subtypes of `AbstractMesh` where
the `Face` should not reproduce the vertices, but rather index into them.
Face is parameterized by:

* `N` - The number of vertices in the face.
* `T` - The type of the indices in the face, a subtype of Integer.
* `O` - The offset relative to Julia arrays. This helps reduce copying when
communicating with 0-indexed systems such ad OpenGL.

be formulated with integers and distances can be measured with floating points.
