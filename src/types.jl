A `Simplex` is a generalization of an N-dimensional tetrahedra and can be thought
of as a minimal convex set containing the specified points.

* A 3-simplex is a tetrahedron.

Note that this datatype is offset by one compared to the traditional
mathematical terminology. So a one-simplex is represented as `Simplex{2,T}`.
This is for a simpler implementation.

It applies to infinite dimensions. The structure of this type is designed
to allow embedding in higher-order spaces by parameterizing on `T`.
